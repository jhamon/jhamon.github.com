Job interviews are stressful, there's no doubt about that. But while you are brushing up on algorithms and practicing your white board technique, remember to set aside some time to think of questions to ask the company giving you the interview.  Interviews are a two way street, and you might regret it later if you don't take advantage of this opportunity to learn about the environment you are committing to for the next phase of your career.

You will probably be asked "do you have any questions multiple times in the course of your interview, and nothing brings the conversation to an awkward halt like not having any ready to fire off. Besides giving you an opportunity to show that you are the kind of smart and thoughtful person they'd like to hire, this is your one opportunity to try to find out something about what goes on behind the scenes at Company X.

All jobs are not created equal. Even at cool companies with relatively high name recognition in the tech world, there are a lot of companies you will want to avoid.

## Who will mentor you?
Mentorship is incredibly important. It's also hard to find.  A good mentor is somebody with both the technical skills to guide you in the right direction, and with enough empathy and interest to make looking out for you a priority.  This goes far beyond being a wizardly coder and extends to how you communicate and are perceived by the rest of the team.

Many people pay lip service to this idea, but mentoring is often thankless work for people with the skill to do it properly. If you're interviewing at a small company you will be interviewed by your future bosses and collegues and you can get a direct read on whether you think you'll have this kind of working relationship with any of your colleagues. 

But even at large companies there are still some things you can ask any technical employees to assess whether mentorship is a company value. 

You want to know if mentorship is valued and practices at Company X. So you ask, 

[ ] Who do you consider your mentor here? What is that relationship like?
[ ] Who have you mentored?

## Do people seem satisfied with their compensation?
Of course it's rude to come out and ask about compensation, and at the interview stage it's really inappropriate to bring up hard figures (add kalzumeus reference here)

## What will you learn from this job?
This is perhaps the most important question of all. Tech changes fast, and if the company is not keeping pace with current trends it's probably not a place to anchor yourself for the next several years of your career. It's hard to keep current if you're using outdated tech all day in your workplace.

This is the question you really want to know the answer to.  But of course you can't ask it in that form.  Instead, ask

* What version of Rails/Django/etc are you on? Is there a plan to upgrade?
* What are the slowest parts of your app? If they don't have an answer for this is tells you that they aren't thinking much about performance which is a huge problem down the road. If they say "rails is slow" then ask them to elaborate. People love to blame rails for performance problems before they've done the work to refactor slow methods, slow queries, etc.

* What frontend frameworks are you using? Why did you choose that one? I don't care that the company is using the latest fad framework, but it's a bit of a red flag to me if the front end is just a pile of disconnected jQuery event listeners.
* What are the biggest technical challenges faced by the company right now? Besides giving you useful information, you might be able to turn this around in the interview and show how you address that need.
