Don't do it

 I recently have the experience of getting a contract hire position. It was an opportunity with a company that been excited about for a long long time, And so I decided to go for it even though I knew that contact higher biased nature is a slightly abusive type of relationship. Company seem to do it when they're scared to hire you full-time after a relatively short encounter. I really want them to want me in their own terms so I did agree to the kind of inheritance bye. And so I started work with this company.

File accounts I was doing very well integrating with the team and making impactful changes my first couple of weeks. After two months, my boss took me aside and said they want to end my contract early because their place of work. Awesome. Then he proceeded to drop a lowball offer of me, Which is both sad unexpected and disappointing. 

I like a 

I'm not getting a bum offer from a company that you just met and maybe you did a five hour interview with getting a lowball offer from the place you've been working with for several weeks or months is emotional punching ago in the gut. Probably the HR people who first thoughtâ€¦ contract hire way fire 

I like to imagine the HR people who first designed contract employment new and understood well the emotional implications for the employee. Interviews or shows over and really the contract hire one situation is over not unlike a two month injury interview. Imagine all the stress that you feel going into normal job interview, multiplied by hundred. It's trivial subtle and your new position, and not all time will you feel like you're being examined what you doing an actual job interview, but you will feel insecure. When you're struggling with a bigger problem when you feel like it's taking too long, You'll have the added stress of wondering whether it will affect the company's decision to hire you or not. If you're feeling sick I want to get day off, you wonder if it will affect you want if your absence Will count as a black mark against you
They're deciding whether to hire. So you go anyway. You put in those extra hours off the clock. Basically you work your ass off, even if you're the type of person who would've worked your ass off anyway because he really believes in what the company trying to accomplish and have a bit more perfectionism then would perhaps be optimal for yourself, the feeling of having to do all the things that are pretty inappropriate over. Months is very unpleasant. 

So that brings back to the bogus job offer. After several weeks or months in the job--a job I wanted otherwise I never would've agreed to this contract hire scenario, I was emotionally invested. And probably the HR people looking up this practice understood that and thought it was just one more way to get you to accept a lower cell salary.	

# Financial costs
Interviewing is expensive. By the time you bring to Canada on site for interview, already spent A lot of time, And therefore money, three mechanic through various stages of screening. Let's say conservatively for you bring candidate on-site you have put them through on the recruiter call, 21 hour technical phone screens. If you go in the time of your engineers about $100 an hour, you're already at the summer hundred dollars in cost before they even set foot in your office. This is ignoring the fact that you have to interview you'll have to screen many candidates for each candidate that makes it to the on-site stage. This also neglects the opportunity cost of the foreground work your end
