                <p>In the past I have had some problems going to bed at a reasonable hour.  When I get interested in something on the computer late at night, I often end up staying up well past the time when I should have gone to sleep.  This is bad because it affects my happiness and productivity significantly the following day.</p>
<p>This has happened to me a lot recently, so I decided to write a little script to nag me about the benefits of regular sleep if I'm on the computer in the wee hours of the morning.</p>
<h3>1. Finding things for my computer to tell me</h3>
<p>I started with a quick google search about healthy sleep to find things for my script to say.  I did a copy/paste on the first couple articles that looked good and edited them into a text file with one fact-filled sentence per line.  I deleted any lines that wouldn't stand on their own as a statement of fact, and gave it a descriptive name: <code>SleepFacts.txt</code>.</p>
<h3>2. Writing the script</h3>
<p>Next I need a small script to print a random line from my text file of sleep facts.  Much as I wish there were a <code>sort --random</code> type of command available, I couldn't find one so decided to write my own in python.  I saved the following into <code>~/scripts/print_random_line.py</code>:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="c">#!/usr/bin/env python</span>
<span class="c"># Prints one random line from a text file, e.g. SleepFacts.txt</span>
<span class="c"># usage: print_random_line.py ~/path/to/file</span>

<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">sys</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">argv</span>
<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">random</span>

<span class="k">try</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">filename</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">argv</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span>
    <span class="nb">file</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">filename</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s">&#39;r&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">except</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">print</span> <span class="s">&#39;File not found.&#39;</span>
    <span class="n">sys</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">exit</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">lines</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">file</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">readlines</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="k">print</span> <span class="n">lines</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">random</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">randrange</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">lines</span><span class="p">))]</span>
<span class="nb">file</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">close</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Next I made the file executable and make it available from the command line by symlinking it to <code>/usr/bin</code>:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo chmod +x ~/scripts/print_random_line.py
<span class="nv">$ </span>ln -s ~/scripts/print_random_line.py /usr/bin/printrl
</pre></div>


<p>Now I'm ready to make the computer say a random line in a text file using the builtin text-to-speech capability.  On a mac:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>printrl SleepFacts.txt | say
<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">echo </span>Jen: <span class="sb">`</span>printrl ~/txt/SleepFacts.txt<span class="sb">`</span> | say <span class="c"># Personalize it!</span>
</pre></div>


<p>or on most linux systems</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>printrl SleepFacts.txt | espeak
</pre></div>


<h3>3. Automating the process</h3>
<p>Awesome.  Now I have something that performs the action I'm after, I just need to schedule it to execute and nudge me toward healthier sleep habits anytime I'm on the computer late at night.  <code>cron</code> is the perfect tool for this.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre> <span class="nv">$ </span>crontab -e
</pre></div>


<p>And put this on a new line:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre> */10 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 * * * /usr/bin/printrl ~/txt/SleepFacts.txt | /usr/bin/say
</pre></div>


<h3>PROFIT!</h3>
<p>Now anytime I'm on the computer after midnight, my computer helpfully nags me every 10 minutes about the benefits of regular sleep.  Was this kind of silly?  Definitely.  But I think it will help me improve my habits.</p>
