Summary: I should have been more proactive and outgoing.


TLDR: Showing up is half the battle.  Massive action is the other 2/3.

When I reflect on my college experience, my biggest regret is that I didn't spend more time being awesome.  By awesome I mean taking the initiative to do interesting things.  I was too busy studying and doing all the things I'm supposed to do.  I was too busy waiting for people to give me permission to do the things I wanted to do.

If I could go back, I would shake myself and say ``LISTEN! You are not here to do problem sets!''  As a naturally introverted person, I think I have shied away from those whose expertise is far beyond mine.  I always want to read a bit more or study a few more things before I'm comfortable taking the next step.  Problem is, I'll never learn everything.  So I get stuck in the learning loop and never take the next step of collaborating, extending, throwing out my own ideas.

The people in this world who are the most successful aren't the smartest people or the most well-connected.  Successful people are the ones who stop pondering all the things that could go wrong, stop worrying about how they aren't quite smart enough, and just start *doing* something.  People who do enough doing eventually get to where they are going.
