Summary: Memorizing poems for fun is precisely the kind of little idiosyncrasy that differentiates a regular person from a really interesting one.

There was recently a [piece in the New Yorker](http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2013/01/why-we-should-memorize.html) in which a professor describes his students balking at the prospect of memorizing poetry for his class.  The piece caught my interest, and so I turned to Google to see what sort of people are memorizing poems these days. I stumbled onto a [2009 article](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/05/books/review/Holt-t.html) by a man who memorizes poetry for fun:

> A few years ago, I started learning poetry by heart on a daily basis. I’ve now memorized about a hundred poems, some of them quite long — more than 2,000 lines in all, not including limericks and Bob Dylan lyrics. I recite them to myself while jogging along the Hudson River, quite loudly if no other joggers are within earshot.

Memorizing poetry recreationally is something I've never thought about attempting, but after reading these pieces I have to admit that I feel drawn to the idea.  I commute on foot around 30 minutes a day, and I think it would be great for my overall mental health if I had a way of transforming that walk from a time for angst about the day's work into a time to relax and enjoy the artistic aspects of language.  

Besides, memorizing poetry is precisely the kind of little idiosyncrasy that differentiates a regular person from a really interesting one.  Having a bizarre hobby or talent like memorizing poetry virtually guarantees that you are not one to waste time clicking refresh on Facebook or following trends in fashion or sports.

Clearly, the ones who spend their down time reciting poems have gone beyond what most people think is cool and important and reached a higher--or at least more interesting--plane.

Maybe I'll start with something nice and musical like Blake's *Tyger*:

    Tyger! Tyger! burning bright 
    In the forests of the night, 
    What immortal hand or eye 
    Could frame thy fearful symmetry? 
    In what distant deeps or skies 
    Burnt the fire of thine eyes? 
    On what wings dare he aspire? 
    What the hand dare sieze the fire? 
    And what shoulder, & what art. 
    Could twist the sinews of thy heart? 
    And when thy heart began to beat, 
    What dread hand? & what dread feet? 
    What the hammer? what the chain? 
    In what furnace was thy brain? 
    What the anvil? what dread grasp 
    Dare its deadly terrors clasp? 
    When the stars threw down their spears, 
    And watered heaven with their tears, 
    Did he smile his work to see? 
    Did he who made the Lamb make thee? 
    Tyger! Tyger! burning bright 
    In the forests of the night, 
    What immortal hand or eye 
    Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?
