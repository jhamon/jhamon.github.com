  <div class="entry-content"><p>Conway&#8217;s Game of Life holds a special place in my heart.  The first non-trivial program I ever wrote was a simple version of the game implemented in Python, and when I decided to learn JavaScript I began by coding up Life.  Life makes a great code kata because it is relatively quick and easy to get a basic version going, but it also leaves a lot of room for experimentation and improvement.</p>


<p><a href="http://www.hamon.io/conway.js"><img class="projects pull-right" src="images/conway_controls.png" alt="User controls for Conway's Game of Life"></a></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve now done this several times in JavaScript, each time learning something new.  My first implementation was to learn basic JavaScript syntax  and the HTML5 Canvas API, but the code was pretty terrible by my current standards. A second implementation went after the low-hanging fruit by improving the separation of concerns between view rendering and game calculations.  </p>




<p>My third JavaScript implementation was to learn more about event-driven programming with Backbone.js.  In the Backbone version, each cell was represented as a Backbone model listening for changes in all its neighbors.  Each div element in the page was bound to a Backbone view that was listening for changes in a cell model.  The Backbone view automatically changed the div&#8217;s CSS styling when the underlying data model fired a change event.</p>




<p>Though by no means &#8220;fast&#8221; compared to other implementations (see the memoized <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashlife">Hashlife</a> algorithm to have your mind blown), my latest rendition of the game adds several improvements.  Most important of these is my use of the HTML5 Web Workers API to offload heavy calculations to another thread.  This allows the UI thread responsible for rendering everything the user sees in the active tab to continue unimpeded while the Life code runs the simluation in the background thread. </p>




<p>
Now that the UI thread is not saturated by Life&#8217;s iterative calculations, I have added a simple web form to allow users to adjust the game&#8217;s parameters.  When users interact with the form, a jQuery click handler sends a message to the background process to adjust the game&#8217;s state.</p>




<p>
I have also improved the algorithmic efficiency in the latest version.  Instead of visiting every cell during every iteration, I now keep track of a &#8220;change list&#8221;.  Since the only thing that can change a cell&#8217;s status is a change in its number of immediate living neighbors, I only need to check the cells that have changed and or whose neighbors have changed.  This is a huge savings in computational expense after the first few chaotic iterations.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I first wrote this game I was still learning the &ldquo;JavaScript way&rdquo; of doing object-oriented programming with prototypical inheritance. I more or less succeeded in that aspect, but the code responsible for rendering the view and managing user interactions was a huge ball of mud. At that time I knew just enough jQuery to be dangerous, and while the basic mechanics seemed to work I had all my truth in the DOM and ran into a wall while trying to extend it to have more features. I wasn&rsquo;t unbinding events properly, so chaos ensued when I tried to reset the game for another play without a hard refresh. It was a mess, but I had other things I wanted to work on.</p>

<h2>Backbone reboot</h2>

<p>I recently revisted the project for a couple of days to apply what I&rsquo;d learned in the intervening months about keeping a clean separation between the <code>DOM</code> and my data with the help of a client-side framework called Backbone.js. I did an almost complete rewrite, and the game is now primarily driven by cascading events. The cell is the fundamental model of the game, which may belong to any of several different collections (<code>snakeSegments</code>, <code>apples</code>, <code>obstacles</code>) depending on the current state of that cell; these collections publish appropriate events when cells are added or removed, which trigger changes elsewhere in the game. For example, when an apple is eaten the game view hears the &ldquo;appleEaten&rdquo; event and knows to update the score and make a new apple.</p>

<p>Each square is a <code>div</code> with <code>display:inline-block</code> and special classes providing styles for each possible state. The squares each have an associated Backbone view that listens for change events on the cell data model. When the Backbone cell model changes, the cell view updates the CSS classes applied to its div element, creating the illusion of objects moving across the board. The game state is now maintained completely separate from the DOM&rsquo;s appearance thanks to views that listen only to data models.</p>

<h2>Rails backend</h2>

<p>This was primarily a JavaScript project, but as a finishing touch I whipped up a simple Ruby on Rails backend to allow users to save scores to a scoreboard. A <code>HighScore</code> model is created when the Backbone app POSTs one to the <code>/high_scores</code> url. I originally fetched the scores with a GET request to <code>/high_scores</code>, but eventually moved to bootstrapping the high score data with the page delivering the Backbone app to avoid an unnecessary XHR request.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While working on several of my side projects, I&rsquo;ve often had a need to store secret information in my project.  I need a way to make things like API keys available to my application without accidentally exposing them to others when, for instance, I push that code to Github or Bitbucket.</p>

<p>Many people much smarter than myself have thought about the problem of managing secrets, and one the suggested solutions is to <a href="http://12factor.net/config">store configuration information in the environment</a>. The advantage of this approach, besides keeping your credentials out of your git history, is that it allows you to easily configure environment-specific as needed by keeping the things that change (the API keys) seperate from the application being deployed.</p>

<p>An example of how this might come into play would be if your application was integrated with a third-party API, like a payment processor, operating on stateful resources.  You probably want to use different API keys for each environment to avoid accidentally charging your customers from dev or staging. Because even if you are writing a lot of tests, you never know for sure that something horrible and unexpected won&rsquo;t happen when you first roll out a new feature.</p>

<p>Keeping environment-specific configuration seperate from the application makes avoiding a horror scenario relatively easy.</p>

<h2>Configuration with Figaro</h2>

<p>Fortunately for us, other people have done the necessary legwork to implement this.  In Rails 4.1, we should be using <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/4_1_release_notes.html#config-secrets-yml"><code>secrets.yml</code></a> to hold confidential information.  But for those still on Rails 3, there&rsquo;s a nice gem called <a href="https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro"><code>figaro</code></a> that does the work of populating environment variables from a configuration file (not checked into version control) for us.</p>

<p>First add the gem to your gemfile</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'>  <span class="c1"># Gemfile</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">&#39;figaro&#39;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And install it from the command line</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'>  <span class="n">bundle</span> <span class="n">install</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="n">figaro</span> <span class="n">install</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The <code>figaro install</code> command creates a <code>config/application.yml</code> file and adds it to <code>.gitignore</code> so that it cannot be checked into version control.</p>

<p>Now we&rsquo;re ready to add some configuration.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='yaml'><span class='line'><span class="c1"># config/application.yml</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">staging</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">twilio_account_sid</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="s">&quot;not_a_real_account_sid_but_you_get_the_idea&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">twilio_auth_token</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="s">&quot;auth_auth_auth_auth_auth_auth_&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">production</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">twilio_account_sid</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="s">&quot;a_totally_different_fake_account_sid&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">twilio_auth_token</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="s">&quot;a_fake_auth_token&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>When our rails application starts, figaro will make the appropriate credentials available in the <code>ENV</code> variable.  We can access these anyway, but often we&rsquo;ll do it in an initializer like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="c1"># config/initializers/twilio.rb</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="no">Twilio</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">configure</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">config</span><span class="o">|</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">config</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">account_sid</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">ENV</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;twilio_account_sid&#39;</span><span class="o">]</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">config</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">auth_token</span>  <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">ENV</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;twilio_auth_token&#39;</span><span class="o">]</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Don&rsquo;t get tripped up</h3>

<p>One gotcha to keep in mind is that <code>ENV</code> is just a simple key value store holding strings. If you try to configure a variable to <code>false</code>, you&rsquo;ll run into trouble because <code>ENV['something_false']</code> will actually be the string <code>"false"</code>, which is truthy. Be vigilant.</p>

<h2>Secure your application secret token, too</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;re publishing your application source code publically while also deploying it, you may have inadvertantly exposed your application&rsquo;s secret token. The token is used to sign cookies, so you have <a href="http://robertheaton.com/2013/07/22/how-to-hack-a-rails-app-using-its-secret-token/">opened yourself up to being hacked</a> if you publish a git repo with this information anywhere in its history.</p>

<p>If you need to, generate a new secret token with <code>rake secret</code>. Then store that secret in your <code>config/application.yml</code> and update <code>config/initializers/secret_token.rb</code> accordingly.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

      <p class="meta">
        








  


<time datetime="2013-11-15T16:05:44-08:00" pubdate data-updated="true"></time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I began <a href="http://www.adoptme.me">AdoptMe.me</a>, I knew it was an ambitious project because of the many moving parts involved.  I learned a lot from the process, both successes and failures, but the project is currently on inedefinite hiatus. You can view the bones live on the web at <a href="http://www.adoptme.me">AdoptMe.me</a>.  </p>




<p>I originally conceived of the site as a cat meme generator in the same vein as icanhascheezburger, but with a social mission of bringing visibility to cats languishing in animal shelters. I thought that if a person is going to spend their time making funny captions for cat images and sharing them around, they might as well give the visibility to a cat that needs it.  </p>


<p><a href="http://www.adoptme.me"><img class="projects pull-left" src="images/AdoptMeme.png" alt="AdoptMe.me meme editor"></a></p>

<p>The technical vision was that I would pull images and data from the free petfinder.com API, push them into my Amazon S3 bucket, let users caption them with a canvas-based JavaScript editor, and then send the resulting image off to my Amazon S3 bucket.  The image would be watermarked with a generated shortlink that viewers of the image could follow to learn more about how to adopt that animal should they be interested in doing so.</p>




<h3>Rails Backend</h3>




<p>A lot needs to happen behind the scenes to create a site handling image media and integrating with third-party APIs.  Since I was deploying on Heroku, first order of business was to find a third-party provider of storage for all my image assets.  Amazon S3 was the obvious choice because it is cheap, fast, and reliable.  Amazon provides an official <span class="code">aws-sdk</span> gem for interacting with their web services, but it contains hundreds of methods for dozens of services so I ended up writing my own <span class="code">Storable</span> module that extends <span class="code">ActiveSupport::Concerns</span> to wrap just the functionality I needed with a simpler API.  My <span class="code">Storable</span> module follows a template pattern, allowing me to easily store and retrieve image data associated with any of my ActiveRecord models by specifying a filename root and including the module.</p>




<p>The backend included models for <span class="code">Pet</span>, <span class="code">Image</span>, and <span class="code">Caption</span>.  Pet models were created and populated using data fetched from the Petfinder JSON API.  I quickly discovered that their free API is worth about what I paid for it (i.e. not much), and I spent a lot of time writing code to clean or discard bogus responses.  <span class="code">Image</span> tracked the metadata for unaltered images associated with a <span class="code">Pet</span>, and <span class="code">Caption</span> tracked metadata for each user-created meme.  Having separate <span class="code">Image</span> and <span class="code">Caption</span> made the associations clear and easily extensible should I want to find, say, all memes with common text content or all memes derived from a particular animal or photo.</p>


<p></p>

<p>I decided not to build views on the server side, because I knew the image editor I wanted to write would involve heavy JavaScript.  So the data in my models is all exposed via a JSON API for consumption by a client-side application I would develop with Backbone.js.</p>




<p>Finally, I used <span class="code">figaro</span> to manage my third-party credentials.  The <span class="code">figaro</span> gem allows me to store my private credentials in an initialization file that is not checked into source control, but the gem will load them into an environment variable for you when the app boots up.</p>




<h3>Backbone.js, HTML5 Canvas Frontend</h3>




<p>Visiting the site you will be served a static page with the Backbone application.  Much of the data is bootstrapped into the page to avoid unnecessary calls to my JSON API.  I made Backbone views for an index page, a meme creation editor, and a show pet/meme page where viewers could learn more about adopting.  Each of these views is complex, and involves one or more sub-views.</p>




<p>Coding an MVP version of the canvas-based meme editor was a straightforward task after some of my other Canvas projects.  A cat image is set as the background for the canvas element.  As the user types, the editor listens to keypress events and updates the overlayed text.  I wanted each image to have a shortlink-style url in the corner where a viewer of the image could visit and learn more about adopting the pet.  So I wrote the shortlink and watermarking logic on the backend, and was nearing the last piece of the MVP puzzle: uploading my newly captioned images.</p>




<h3> Problems with the Same-Origin Policy</h3>




<p>It is at that moment that I ran head-on into a Same-Origin security error.  I learned, painfully, that the browser&#8217;s Same-Origin Policy was not going to let me save any of my users meme images directly to S3 because the background cat image was not coming from the same origin as the page I was serving from Heroku.  What I thought was going to be as easy as a call to <span class="code">canvas.toDataURL()</span> ended up being a much bigger problem.</p>




<p>I fiddled with server side generation of the captioned images using <span class="code">imagemagick</span> via the <span class="code">rmagick</span> gem.  I actually got this to work and its what you will experience if you try to use the live version of the site at this time.  This backend image manipulation is why the actual results do not match the editor preview. I realized quickly, however, that <span class="code">imagemagick</span> was slow, and I knew that blocking my Rails application with big image processing jobs was going to be unacceptably slow with more than one or two concurrent users.  And the image work wasn&#8217;t a candidate to be a deferred job because the user is waiting to see their creation and share it around on the web.  </p>




<h3> Hiatus </h3>




<p>Given my knowledge at the time, the whole thing seemed unsalvageable at that point.  I made the decision to put the project on hold while I kept learning and working on other things, hoping to get back to it one day and do the job right.  Since then I&#8217;ve learned that what I originally intended may be possible with CORS, Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, so I&#8217;m excited to pick up again where I left off.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I met somebody doing the <a href="http://www.hackbrightacademy.com/">Hackbright Academy</a> bootcamp. I remember looking at that program earlier this year when I was evaluating the available paths through my career change from science into software development. Even though Hackbright has a shiny website and a decent reputation, I ruled them out quickly because I don’t want to be a <em>female programmer</em>. I don’t want to get hired as a <em>female programmer</em>, and I definitely don&rsquo;t want to be the token female filling out a company’s diversity quota. It seems as if Hackbright and similar women-only programs, though well-intentioned, should be a magnet for companies looking to pad their gender ratio, and I just don’t want to be recruited on that basis.</p>

<p>Honestly, I just want to keep learning and working on interesting problems. Code is code, and I don&rsquo;t want any well-meaning developer-mentors using their kid gloves to take what should be a sink-or-swim extreme learning situation and turn it into happy fun play time. I’m sure the program is probably very good, but I couldn’t suppress my horror-fantasy about it being a programming sorority.</p>

<p>I also worry that women-only events make the problem worse by reinforcing stereotypes and segregating women from the rest of the developer community. I don’t see how it helps women get over their impostor syndrome and take up the programmer identity if women-only events are always emphasizing the fact that they aren’t regular programmers—they’re female programmers.</p>

<p>I haven’t had any problems with the atmosphere or men at App Academy; the program is about 80% male. I would recommend that any women considering bootcamps try not to be intimidated by the ratio. Unless you’re going on to a female-only job in a female-only company (you’re not), you’re eventually going to have to deal with working in a male-heavy professional environment. Might as well do it sooner than later and avoid the female programmer ghetto.</p>
