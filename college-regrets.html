        <p><span class="caps">TLDR</span>: Showing up is half the battle.  Massive action is the other&nbsp;2/3.</p>
<p>When I reflect on my college experience, my biggest regret is that I didn&#8217;t spend more time being awesome.  By awesome I mean taking the initiative to do interesting things.  I was too busy studying and doing all the things I&#8217;m supposed to do.  I was too busy waiting for people to give me permission to do the things I wanted to&nbsp;do.</p>
<p>If I could go back, I would shake myself and say &#8220;<span class="caps">LISTEN</span>! You are not here to do problem sets!&#8221;  As a naturally introverted person, I think I have shied away from those whose expertise is far beyond mine.  I always want to read a bit more or study a few more things before I&#8217;m comfortable taking the next step.  Problem is, I&#8217;ll never learn everything.  So I get stuck in the learning loop and never take the next step of collaborating, extending, throwing out my own&nbsp;ideas.</p>
<p>The people in this world who are the most successful aren&#8217;t the smartest people or the most well-connected.  Successful people are the ones who stop pondering all the things that could go wrong, stop worrying about how they aren&#8217;t quite smart enough, and just start <em>doing</em> something.  People who do enough doing eventually get to where they are&nbsp;going.</p>
