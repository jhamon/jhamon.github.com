Title: Go where the makers are

The last time I was unemployed I utterly failed at getting traction with employers.  In retrospect, my failure was an obvious consequence of my approach:

    - Not identifying my target niche
    - Sending resumes for advertised jobs
    - Sending generic or slightly tweaked resumes for each position
    - Not networking

It seems like everybody knows that "spray and pray" is a terrible strategy for landing a job.

This go around, I have a clearer strategy:

    - Identify target jobs
    - Learn and polish relevant skills
    - Work and mingle in areas where key decision makers hang out
