-----------------------------------

I was originally attracted to geosciences because from 30,000 feet the subject matter has a certain aesthetic appeal.  When I think about the scale and size and antiquity of the Earth, I feel humble and in awe that I even exist at all.  I'm not a religious person, but that feeling of awe toward nature is what originally drew me in to science as vocation.  

But I now know those feelings of awe have little to do with the day to day life of a person in academia.  Recognizing this, I've been telling myself for a while now that I have a decision to make about whether to stay in science.  But the truth is I have already decided; the crossroads is weeks (months?) in the rearview mirror.  I decided when I felt the need to ask the question.  I decided when I started seeking opportunities outside the scientific realm.  I decided when I started ignoring my homework to go network at local tech meetups and work on programming.  I decided when I spent my weekend applying to Hacker School instead of a small grant opportunity.  I decided.

I do feel guilty about leaving after taking up other peoples' time and resources.  There are people in this program who've invested in me who I look up to, and I feel ashamed to let them down.  But guilty feelings are not good reasons to stay, so I know it's the right thing.  I've been having that feeling confirmed daily.  Somebody said yesterday in a meeting that if you don't love what you're doing then science isn't worth it.  They are right.

I don't love it.  I don't love trying to build a personal brand in the prestige economy that science turns on.  My ego and my ambition just is not big enough to succeed at this.  

I don't love feeling like I need to be the best in the world at my particular thing just to have a chance at success.  

I don't love working in isolation on things that nobody cares about, that few people will read, and that affect nobody's life.  I am terrified by the truth in the Ziman quote about a scientist being "a person who knows more and more about less and less, until he knows everything about nothing."

I don't love getting by on a meager stipend while my friends who have real jobs are buying cars, saving for retirement, and starting businesses.

I don't love contemplating a future where, in one of the better case scenarios, the "two body problem" means I'll probably face choosing between optimizing for career and optimizing for family.

And I don't love the culture where everyone who doesn't have tenure is afraid all the time: afraid their project won't work, afraid their paper won't get published, afraid they aren't working enough even though they work all the time, afraid somebody will make them look dumb, afraid somebody will copy their idea, afraid they won't get a job, afraid the grant that they depend on won't get renewed, and so on.  I see this from top to bottom in staff, junior faculty, and students.

I don't love it.  And I've had enough. 

## Recognizing my true values

I want to work with people who 

While I have benefitted and will continue to benefit from the brand name universities on my resume, I do not fundamentally believe in credentialism and academic pedigree.  I think in the future, those who can teach themselves and show evidence of skills that provide value to others will have a higher trajectory than those relying on the diploma to paper over their shortcomings.  And I don't want to be a 30-something with a PhD in bullshitology, filled with despair as I realize that nobody in the real world believes in credentialism like academics.
