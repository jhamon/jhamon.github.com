Title: Learning algorithms the firehose way

Status: Draft
Summary: I decided to take CS 38 Algorithms at Caltech without ever having taken discrete math, computability, any of the other half-dozen prerequesites.  Extreme hilarity (and learning) ensues.
==============

Since I decided this year to try pivoting into a technology career, I got the idea to take advantage of the computer science classes available to me here during my last quarter at Caltech.  Why not, right?

So I looked through the catalog, and as you might imagine the most interesting course being offered at this time is called algorithms.  Who doesn't want to learn how to approach problems more efficiently, right?  Right.  So far it's been a blast despite my lacking numerous prerequisites (discrete math, probability theory, computability, etc).  

I'm the first to admit that I'm not qualified to be in the room, but awareness of that has helped me enjoy the experience rather than be shutdown by the terror of feeling that I must learn something to earn a good grade. In my experience, nothing ruins my enjoyment of a class more than the feeling of obligation.  **I must do this problem set or I will get a bad grade.** Since I'm exiting academia and already have my degree requirements in hand, I can discard those feelings of obligation
and just dive in and see what sticks in a type of class that I would never have considered taking when I was still worried about grades.

So, then, some tips for other people considering taking a class that they are wildly underprepared for:

* Find a few good references.  Your google fu is helpful in a pinch, but for advanced topics much of the best information is still to be found in books.

* Don't be ashamed to ask for help.  This one is hard because nobody likes to look like the dumb kid, but if you have a question about something there are probably other people who are wondering the same thing.

* Show up to class and recitations.  I have often skipped these in classes more in my comfort zone, but when you're pushing the limits of what is possible you've got to commit to doing whatever it takes --- even if that means waking up for the early morning class.
