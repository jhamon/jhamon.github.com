I'm going to land a job a software developer before the end of this year.  In a world where more and more happens online every day, learning to control computers seems like the only way to have any kind of freedom or influence.  I don't want my use of computers to be constrained to what others are willing to build for me.  Programming is the new literacy.  Even relatively simple web apps and API mashups can have a large impact.  I want to be a part of building that future.  

I've coded before in scientific contexts -- mostly Python and MATLAB with a smattering of other things -- but never professionally. I know enough to know there's a lot I don't know.  So I'm spending the next several months trying to fill some of the largest gaps between where I am now and where apprentice software devs should be.

A lot of well-intentioned people have advised me to work on my coding hobby on the side while I continue my doctoral program.  "Why give up the paycheck?" they say. And while I appreciate their concern and see the pragmatic value in their advice, I am respectfully declining to follow it. Bridges, backup plans, and other outs are for people who plan to fail. **Staying in graduate school and programming on the side is a plan to be thoroughly mediocre at both.** 

## I'm terrified to fail. That's why I'm going to succeed.

I'm burning the boats behind me.  It worked for Cortez. It worked for Alexander.  And I hope it'll work for me.  I'm committed. I'm going to become a software developer or bust.

I know anybody with a software background out there reading this is probably rolling their eyes at a newb like me planning to land a solid software job before the end of the year. I know it's not going to be easy.  I'm counting on my own smarts, interest in the field, and *pure terror of failing* to get me there.

So I've gathered a small pile of ruby books, got my environment configured, and somafm tuned in.  I'll probably be writing somewhat irregularly about my experiences to help myself learn and also to hopefully provide encouragement to others pursuing a radical career change.  But I know that won't work for me.  

I know anybody with a software background out there reading this is probably rolling their eyes at a noob like me planning to land a solid software job before the end of the year.  I'm counting on my own smarts, interest in problem solving, and pure terror of failing to get me there.

So I've gathered a small pile of ruby books, have vim fired up, and somafm tuned in. See you on the flip side.
