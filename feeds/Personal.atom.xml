Massive action is the other&amp;nbsp;2/3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I reflect on my college experience, my biggest regret is that I didn&amp;#8217;t spend more time being awesome.  By awesome I mean taking the initiative to do interesting things.  I was too busy studying and doing all the things I&amp;#8217;m supposed to do.  I was too busy waiting for people to give me permission to do the things I wanted to&amp;nbsp;do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I could go back, I would shake myself and say &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LISTEN&lt;/span&gt;! You are not here to do problem sets!&amp;#8221;  As a naturally introverted person, I think I have shied away from those whose expertise is far beyond mine.  I always want to read a bit more or study a few more things before I&amp;#8217;m comfortable taking the next step.  Problem is, I&amp;#8217;ll never learn everything.  So I get stuck in the learning loop and never take the next step of collaborating, extending, throwing out my own&amp;nbsp;ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people in this world who are the most successful aren&amp;#8217;t the smartest people or the most well-connected.  Successful people are the ones who stop pondering all the things that could go wrong, stop worrying about how they aren&amp;#8217;t quite smart enough, and just start &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt; something.  People who do enough doing eventually get to where they are&amp;nbsp;going.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="personal"></category><category term="goals"></category></entry></feed>
