                <h1 class="entry-title"><a href="../emacs-and-org-mode.html">Emacs and&nbsp;Org-Mode</a></h1>
                <p>I&#8217;ve finally gotten emacs up and running and configured in a way that
I like.  I think org-mode is just the thing I&#8217;ve been looking for.
I&#8217;ve tried out a half a dozen todo list and productivity apps and they
all suffer from the same couple of&nbsp;problems.</p>
<p>I found the desktop solutions (OmniFocus and Things) to both be
encumbered by clunky user interfaces.  For instance, when I&#8217;m trying
to add a new item to a project, I shouldn&#8217;t have to click more than
once or twice to enter all the relevant details: Project name, notes,
dates, and attachments.  Things was definitely more attractive than
OmniFocus, but the inability to tab through <span class="caps">ALL</span> the settings is a deal
breaker for me. If I&#8217;m going to be using something dozens of times per
day and hundreds of times per week my interaction needs to be fluid.
The software solution needs to&nbsp;disappear.</p>
<p>Secondary concerns with proprietary solutions&#8212;including cloud-based
services like Remember the Milk, Springpad, and Evernote&#8212;is that they
have absolute control over you data.  If the company dies, your data
goes with it unless you have a reliable backup system in&nbsp;place.</p>
<p>But even more important, I would really prefer to do everything I can
anywhere <span class="caps">OTHER</span> than the browser.  When I&#8217;m trying to be productive, I
don&#8217;t want to be one tab over from timesucks like facebook,
stackoverflow, or nytimes.com.  Any gains from staying organized with
online tools like that are surely lost to these temptations.  For me
and probably many&nbsp;others</p>
<p>No, I think emacs is the way to go.  Or vim.  Hell, some people are
now charging upwards of $30 for minimalist editors, which says
something about the needs of people who are really ready to settle
down and do some work.  I&#8217;ve read that oldschool hackers would spend
80+% of their &#8220;tube time&#8221; in editors like vi or emacs.  I&#8217;m not sure
if it&#8217;s true or not, but if it is that explains a lot about how they
managed to hack together something as massive and complex as
<span class="caps">GNU</span>/Linux.  Trying to work in a web browser is like studying with the
<span class="caps">TV</span> on.  It&#8217;s just not a good idea.  If yesterdays hackers had been
trying to write <span class="caps">GNU</span>/Linux under the conditions people find on modern
computers&#8211;with social media, streaming video, lolcats, and the whole
universe&#8211;mere seconds away&#8230;. well, I might be writing this on a
Windows computer because I&#8217;m not sure those good samaritans would have
been able to resist the temptation long enough to create an entire
operating&nbsp;system.</p>
<p>There was a recent post on Slashdot about research to this effect:
truly great work happens in solitude, after much hard thinking.  So,
for now, I&#8217;m embracing org-mode.  It&#8217;s a complicated animal, but I&#8217;m
excited to start down this new rode of productive peace.  It&#8217;s just me
and this little blinking cursor.  Together we will do great&nbsp;things.</p>
<p>(I literally wrote this as a stream-of-conciousness over 10-15 minutes
before bed.  Don&#8217;t judge me for ill-formed paragraph&nbsp;structures.)</p>
