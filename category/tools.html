                <h1 class="entry-title"><a href="../emacs-and-org-mode.html">Emacs and Org-Mode</a></h1>
                
                <p>I've finally gotten emacs up and running and configured in a way that
I like.  One thing I've discovered that I really like is something called "Org-Mode", which at first appears to be just an outlining tool but is actually a versital way to keep track of projects, tasks, and deadlines all from inside the text editor.  I think org-mode is just the thing I've been looking for to keep myself organized and on-task.  </p>
<p>I've tried out a half a dozen dedicated todo list and productivity apps and they  all suffer from the same couple of problems.  I found the desktop solutions (e.g. OmniFocus and Things) to be
encumbered by clunky user interfaces that are frustrating to me as somebody who loves keyboard shortcuts.  For instance, when I'm trying
to add a new item to a project, I shouldn't have to click more than
once or twice to enter all the relevant details: Project name, notes,
dates, and attachments.  Things was definitely more attractive than
OmniFocus, but the inability to tab through ALL the settings is a deal  breaker for me. If I'm going to be using something dozens of times per day and hundreds of times per week my interaction needs to be fluid.  The software solution needs to disappear.</p>
<p>Secondary concerns with proprietary solutions--including cloud-based
services like Remember the Milk, Springpad, and Evernote--is that they
have absolute control over you data.  If the company dies, your data
goes with it unless you have a reliable backup system in place.</p>
<p>But even more important, I would really prefer to do everything I can
anywhere OTHER than the browser.  When I'm trying to be productive, I
don't want to be one tab over from timesucks like Hacker News,
stackoverflow, or nytimes.com.  Any gains from staying organized with
online tools like that are surely lost to these temptations.  For me
and probably many others</p>
<p>No, I think emacs is the way to go.  Or vim.  Hell, some people are
now charging upwards of $30 for minimalist editors (just look at Writeroom on the Mac App Store), which I think says
something about the needs of people who are really ready to settle
down and do some work.  I've read that oldschool hackers would spend
80+% of their "tube time" in editors like vi or emacs.  I'm not sure
if it's true or not, but if it is that explains a lot about how they
managed to hack together something as massive and complex as
GNU/Linux.  Trying to work in a web browser is like studying with the
TV on.  It's just not a good idea.  If yesterdays hackers had been
trying to write GNU/Linux under the conditions people find on modern
computers---with social media, streaming video, lolcats, and the whole
universe---mere seconds away.... well, I might be writing this on a
Windows computer because I'm not sure those good samaritans would have
been able to resist the temptation long enough to create an entire
operating system.</p>
<p>There was a recent post on Slashdot about research to this effect:
truly great work happens in solitude, after much hard thinking.  So,
for now, I'm embracing org-mode.  It's a complicated animal, but I'm
excited to start down this new rode of productive peace.  It's just me and this little blinking cursor.  Together we will do great things.</p>
